--> Infastructure as a Service
--> Provide Virtual Machines
--> Private service by default. Since by default uses the default VPC, so 	 public IP is assigned to it by default,
--> EC2 is Instance is Availability Zone resilient.
--> Different sizes and capabilities are available.
--> On Demand Billing  (per second or per hour) based on the software launched by the instance.
--> Charges
	a) for compute and memory.
	b) for storage
	c) for any commercial software is used in the instance

--> Instance can have different kind of storages
	a) Local on host storage
	b) EBS (Elastic Block Storage). This is a network storage
	
--> Instance can have different states
	a) Running 
	b) Stopped
	c) Terminated
	
	Running --> Stopped --> Running
	Running --> Terminated (Instance will end)
	
	* Running state will generate charges for cpu, memory, storage and network
	* Stopped state will generate charges for storage
	* Terminated state will delete the instance and storage so no charges
	
--> IAM (Amazon Machine Image)
	* can be used to create an EC2 instance
	* can be created from an EC2 instance
	* Similar to server image or a USB
	* AMI have different properties like permission
		a) Public (anyone can use it)
		b) Implicit (Only Owner)
		c) Explicit (specific AWS account are allowed to use the AMI)
	* Have Root Volumne
	* Block Device Mapping (map volumes to the device ID's)
	
--> Connecting to EC2 instances
	*RDP (Remote Desktop protocol) for windows based machine , port 3389 is used for this
	*SSH for linux instance. port 22 is used for this
	*SSH key pair is used to authenticate the connection. Private part is downloaded and kept save. Public part is attached to the EC2 instance
