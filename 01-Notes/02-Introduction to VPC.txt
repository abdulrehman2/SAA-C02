VPC= Virtual Private Cloud
1 VPC belongs to 1 account and 1 region
Two Types of VPC are available in a region
	a) Default (Only one in a region). Less flexible. Can be deleted and recreated.
	b) Custom VPC's (Multiple in a region). Configure according to your requirements. Configure everything by yourself. All things are private by default. Can be linked with other VPC's.
	
Default VPC:
 --> Always configured in the same predictable way.
 --> CIDR for default VPC is always the same 172.31.0.0/16
 --> VPC is a region resilient service. VPC is made resilient by dividing the network into subnets.
 --> One subnet in every availablity zone.
