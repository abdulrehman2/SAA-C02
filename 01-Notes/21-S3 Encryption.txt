S3 can have 2 types of Encryption
	-Client Side Encryption
	-Server Side Encryption
	
Encryption for S3 only means encryption at rest, during transit, data will be encrypted through TLS(HTTPS) for S3 endpoint


============Client Side Encryption============
--Data will be encrypted by the user, and will be sent in encrypted form to S3 and will be stored, AWS will not know what is the data.
--User is responsible for decrypting the data as well


===========Server Side Encryption=============
There are 3 types of server side encryption available in S3

1) SSE-C (Data and Key will be provided by the user to encrypt the data, key will be discarded, hash of key is saved along with data)
	--For decryption, key shall be provided again
	
2) SSE-S3 
	 Encryption and key to encrypt will be handled by S3,
	 everytime an object is uploaded, a key is created from the master key to encrypt the data
	 AES-256 algorithm is used to encrypt the data
	 
	--Advantages
	1) No encryption overhead
	
	--Disadvantage
	1) Keys are invisible
	2) Can't rotate the keys
	3) Role seperation is difficult to acheive (one role can only manage keys, while other can see the data)
	
	
	
	

3) SSE-KMS (Encryption is handled by S3 using key stored in KMS)
