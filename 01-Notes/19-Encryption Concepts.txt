Plaintext: data to encrypt
Alogrithm: a complex program or mathemetical equation use to encrypt data
Key: A password or some random string to encrypt the data
CipherText: encrypted text, produced by using key,plaintext and algorithm


==========Encryption at Rest===============
when data is stored on laptop and single party is involved, then data can be encrypted using a key and then can be decrypted by providing the same key


==========Encryption at Transit============
When two or more parties are involved, then the transit of data need to encrypted, so that anyone stalking will see scrambled data.


===========Symetric Encryption=============
In symetric encryption, key is shared by both parties, and one party can send the data in encrypted form, while other can decrypt it using the shared private key.

-Disadvantage (transfer of private key is risky and can be leaked)
-Advantage (faster and less computation required than asymetric)


===========Asymetric Encyption=============
Party that needs to receive the data, will create a public and private key.
Public key will be shared with the party that need to send encrypted data.
Sending party  will encrypt the data using the public key
Only Receiving party can decrypt the data using the private key.

-Disadvantage (complex and require more computation)
-Advantage (more secure)


==================Signing======================
Once receiving party receive the data, then they can send a OK message, but this message can be sent by anyone, so how to check whether it was send by the correct party.
Receiving party will sign the ok message with private key, then it can only be decrypted by the public key available by the orignal sender
