1) DNS is available for VPC.
IP Address + 2  is the DNS address 
enableDNSHostname ==> this setting will set hostname for instances inside VPC
enableDNSSupport ==> this setting will enable resolution of DNS in VPC


Every subnet has 5 less address of total

10.16.16.0/20
Network address Start 10.16.16.0 
Network address + 1   10.16.16.1 (for VPC Router)
Network address + 2	  10.16.16.2 (for DNS)
Network address + 3	  10.16.16.3 (Reserved for Future)
Network address End	  10.16.31.3 (Reserved for Future)
