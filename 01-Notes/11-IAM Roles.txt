IAM Roles is an identity in AWS that will be used 
	-when the principle is external user,
	-An application/system need access to AWS resouces 
	-when the number of users are greater than 5000
	-when we don't know the actual number of users/principles needed access to AWS
	
	
An IAM Role has a permission policy that list all the permissions and it has a trust policy.
	-Permission policy list all the permissions
	-Trust policy list all the users/principles that are allowed to assume that role
	

Once an identity assume that particular role, AWS will generate a temporary credentials that can be used to get access to the AWS resources.

Scenarios where we can use IAM Role instead of IAM users

	1) Mobile application with million of users, instead of using users, we can use Identity Federation, and allow users to login with Facebook/Twitter and these users can assume a particular role defined in the account
	2) Lambda function running in AWS, instead of hardcoding access keys, we should allow the access through IAM role to a particular resource
	3) Allow to use existing credentials in corporate environment for example using existing Active Directory credentials
