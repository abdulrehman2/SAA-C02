Versioning
--Enable at bucket level.
--Once versioning is enabled, then it cannot be disabled
--You can suspend versioning, but it can be enabled again
--Name of object is the key,
	Id=null means versioning is disabled
	
	Lastest version/Current version is the last object with version
	
Deletion is also affected by versioning
-- if no version is specified, then S3 add a new marker to the current version and hides the previous versions
-- if the object is undeleted, then all the previous versions are available again 


Versions of an object can be deleted, and it will be hard delete

if an object is deleted, then the most recent version becomes the (Current Version).
