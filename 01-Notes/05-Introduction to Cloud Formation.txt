* Templates to create, update and delete infrastructure 
YAML and JSON are both supported

--> All templates has a list of resources (mandatory part)
--> Description (provide details regarding template)
--> AWSTemplateFormatVersion key is not mandatory, but if Description added then it should be right after AWSTemplateFormatVersion
	(Trick Question in Exam)
--> Metadata (Control the UI), how UI is presented in the console
--> Parameters, prompt the user to provide more information, for example name of instance, type and size of instance	
	Mappings, optional
--> Conditions
--> Outputs, return or display the items in the result screen.

A templated will create a staack that will hold the logical resources, CF then create the physical resources based on the stack, and CF will make sure to sync the logical and physical resources. 
If the stack is updated through the tempalte then the actual resources will be updated,
If the stack is deleted then the CF will delete the actual resources
