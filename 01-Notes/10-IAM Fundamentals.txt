--Policies
	*A policy is a JSON document, listing all the entitlements a user can have
	*By default all resources are denyed for a user
	*Explicit Deny, Explicit Allow, Implicit Deny (Clear rule for any resource access to an identity)
	--Types of Policies
		*Inline (Same policy can be applied to multiple users but change for every user is done seperatley)
		*Managed (One policy can be applied to multiple users). Changing it will affect all the users.
	
--Users
	*Whenver a human, application or a system neeed an access to aws, User identity is used.
	*Only 5000 users can exist inside one AWS account (Hard Limit). So we need to think about during design whether to use IAM users for a    particular system if the no of users exceeds 5000, in that case identity federation is way to go
	*A user can only belong to maximum 10 groups
	
--Groups
	*Groups are containers for users
	*Groups are not actual identities, they donot have username/password, and we cannot login with groups
	*Groups cannot be used as a principal during assigning resource policies 
	
--Resource Policies
	*Policies attached to resources instead of identities, and it  contains identities which can have access or restriction to these particular resources
