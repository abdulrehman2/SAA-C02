*It is a regional service

*Cloud watch logs is a service that will allow to store, monitor and access logging data
	--Data can be sent to the service through 3 ways
		a) Directly by AWS services, through IAM roles 
		b) By installing AWS unified agent  on the server
		c) By using development kit directly inside the application/system
		
*Logging sources produces the (Log Events). Log events will atleast have a timestamp and message, Cloud Watch Logs treats them as a raw data. These events are stored inside (LogStreams). 
	--(Log Streams) are logs from the same source
	--(Log Groups) are groups for log streams for same type of logs. Premission and retentions are defined at group level. And also metrics are set at this level


*Metrics can be added on the logs, for example we can have metric filter to check failed requests to EC2 instance through SSH
	--Metric is incremented whenever a condition is met for example (failed SSH try to EC2 Instance)
	--Metrics can have alarms
