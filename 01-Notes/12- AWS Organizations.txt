AWS Organizations allow to  manage different AWS accounts from a single management account
	-Existing Accounts can be added into organization, and upon accepting invitation, they become member accounts
	-From management account we can role switch to other member accounts
	-OrganizationAccountAccessRole will be created in the new accounts automatically, while for existing accounts we need to create them manually in the target account.
